Powered by real-time data and insights, our unified engagement platform helps sales and marketing teams find, acquire, and grow customers. You will lead a team of talented designers, engineers, marketers, and analysts to build the best data product, enabling our customers to unlock insights, engage customers, and win faster.\nThis role will drive the user experience of interest and fit-based signals, scores, and models such as Intent and ICP, delivered through SaaS UX, agentic AI, as well as Data Cube (data as a service). You will drive a multi-disciplinary team to innovate and help our customers adopt these scores and insights into their ZoomInfo platform, CRM system, and MarTech ecosystem. These innovations will empower our customers to focus resources on prospects that are most likely buying group members, and opportunities most likely to close.\nWhat You’ll Do:\n\nOwn Product Lifecycle: Champion products from early-stage ideation, through a successful launch, and into monitoring and iterative improvements.\nSet Vision and Roadmap: Paint a compelling vision and roadmap for the product, ensuring alignment with department and company objectives at every step.\nCustomer Engagement: Regularly engage with customers to understand their needs and inform product decisions.\nDefine and Analyze Metrics: Identify key metrics, implement tracking, analyze data, and translate insights into high-impact product initiatives.\nCustomer Advocate: Promote customer-centric culture through exemplary behavior.

You’re the focal point!\nStakeholder Updates: Drive alignment across the organization by articulating product strategies with compelling narratives through regular, written updates to all stakeholders (including executives).\n\nWhat You’ll Bring:\n\nData is your passion. You’ve built complex data products before and chase the rush of extracting signal from noise and delivering the predictive power to users with simplicity and elegance.&nbsp;\nYou thrive when presented with ambiguity. You prefer tackling problems with no clear or obvious solution, and like to get your hands dirty becoming an expert in what you are trying to solve. You have 5+ years of product management experience, and are comfortable setting a product strategy, roadmap, and executing on it.\nYou’re a strong written communicator. You have a proven track record of clearly and effectively conveying complex product concepts and strategies in writing to various audiences. This includes developing compelling product narratives, crafting detailed Product Requirement Documents, and communicating product roadmaps and release plans across the organization.\nYou have a proven track record driving measurable business outcomes in data-focused products. You are skilled at rallying teams around key performance indicators tied to company goals, and adept at connecting daily work to long-term business impact.\nYou have strong product intuition guided by gut feeling, but back up those instincts with hard data. Your product sense is sharpened by your expertise in leveraging data analytics. You live and breathe in tools like Amplitude and Tableau, and can’t help rolling up your sleeves to write some SQL or Python to understand data better and answer your own questions.\nYou are driven to make a major impact on Zoominfo's bottom line. You build great products to power significant new business opportunities and revenue streams.\nYour True North is delivering an insanely great experience for every customer. Turning these insights into product improvements is what fuels you.\nDesign gets you energized. You perk up when you receive Figma files, eager to collaborate with designers on flows and features. You love pairing with product designers to bring innovative, delightful experiences to life.\n\nWhat Does Success Look Like:\n\nYou will drive product strategy and execution for signal-based, interest and ICP-related data products, develop new innovative offerings that leverage modern data visualization, traditional machine learning, GenAI, as well as agentic AI.\nThrough partnership with Marketing and GTM teams on positioning, messaging, and release notes, users will understand our Intent and Scorings offerings and how to use them.\nEngineering and Data Science teams will see you as a trusted partner and enabler to help solve complex problems, define requirements, and to build metrics to help monitor the efficacy and quality of our predictive analytics data products.&nbsp;\nCustomers, prospects, and the industry will know you as a trusted advisor and partner in understanding how ZoomInfo Intent and predictive scores can help them identify or predict buying group members, understand, prioritize, and engage at the right moment when companies are in the market for their products.\n\nHow We Work:\n\nBe Relentless. We will be relentless: when we deliver value to clients; when we compete; when we run into difficult problems. We will outpace and outcompete our competition. We are smart, clever, and resourceful in everything we do. Competing with us for the same customers will be a daunting experience.\nBe Entrepreneurs. Entrepreneurs hustle, move fast, take ownership, they have autonomy, and make decisions. They are accountable, but they do not operate in fear, they aren’t afraid to fail. They are resilient, resourceful, and solutions-oriented - even when conditions say otherwise. We will entrust, and expect, our leadership and our teams to operate as entrepreneurs.\nBe Experts. Winning for our customers requires that we understand them deeply. Winning for our business requires us to be experts in our domain areas. Great companies solve complex and costly problems for their customers - you can’t do this without being an expert in your customers’ day-to-day workflow. We will demand this level of customer and business expertise from everyone at the company.\nBe Innovators. Innovating is who we are, it is how we have gotten here. But not just with our product and how we define what GTM means for the future. We innovate to be leaner and more efficient in the way we operate, we will find ways to drive outcomes no one thought were possible - from marketing and lead generation to legal, finance, and procurement. Through innovation, we will set a new standard for how great companies operate with discipline.\nBe a Team. We can’t win if we act like a random assortment of siloed groups. We are one team, working together to win. We collaborate and lean in to help each other.\n\n&nbsp; \n&nbsp; Actual compensation offered will be based on factors such as the candidate’s work location, qualifications, skills, experience and/or training.
