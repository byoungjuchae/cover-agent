        "jobDescription": "DescriptionAmazon.com is broadly recognized as a leader in providing exceptional Customer Service globally. At Amazon, we are driven by innovation and customer obsession, which is deeply ingrained in everything we do, especially in the Customer Engagement Technology (CET) department. Leveraging conversational Artificial Intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) technology, we strive to predict and resolve customer issues through self-service and automation solutions.The CET team leads AI and Large Language Models (LLM)-driven customer experience transformation using task-oriented dialogue systems. We develop multi-modal, multi-turn, goal-oriented dialog systems that can handle customer issues at Amazon scale across multiple languages. These systems are designed to adapt to changing company policies and invoke correct Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) to automate solutions to customer problems. Additionally, we enhance associate productivity through response/action recommendation, summarization to capture conversation context succinctly, retrieving precise information from documents to provide useful information to the agent, and machine translation to facilitate smoother conversations when the customer and agent speak different languages.Key Focus Areas Include Task-Oriented Dialog Systems: Building reliable, scalable, and adaptive LLM-based agents for understanding intents, determining eligibilities, making API calls, confirming outcomes, and exploring alternatives across hundreds of customer service intents, while adapting to changing policies. Lifelong Learning: Researching continuous learning approaches for injecting new domain knowledge while retaining the model's foundational abilities and preventing catastrophic forgetting. Agentic Systems: Developing a modular agentic framework to handle multi domain conversations through appropriate system abstractions. Complex Multi-turn Instruction Following: Identifying approaches to guarantee compliance with instructions that specify standard operating procedures for handling multi-turn complex scenarios. Inference-Time Adaptability: Researching inference-time scaling methods and improving in-context learning abilities of custom models to enable real-time adaptability to new features, actions, or bug fixes without solely relying on retraining. Context Adherence: Exploring methods to ground responses in specific customer attributes, account information, and behavioral data to prevent hallucinations and ensure high-fidelity responses. Policy Grounding: Investigating techniques to align bot behavior with evolving company policies by grounding on complex, unstructured policy documents, ensuring consistent and compliant actions. End-to-End Dialog Policy Optimization: Researching alignment approaches to optimize successful dialog completions. Scalable Evaluations: Developing automated approaches to evaluate the quality of experience, and correctness of agentic resolutions.Key job responsibilities Research and development of LLM-based chatbots and conversational AI systems for customer service applications. Design and implement state-of-the-art Natural Language Processing (NLP) and ML models for tasks such as language understanding, dialogue management, and response generation.
